## Project Overview

**ClearMark** is a modern, feature-rich markdown editor built with React and TypeScript. It leverages Slate.js for rich text editing capabilities and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI. The editor is designed to provide a seamless writing experience while maintaining the simplicity and power of markdown.

## Purpose & Motivation

### Why ClearMark Exists

Modern markdown editing should be both powerful and intuitive. ClearMark aims to:

- Provide a rich text editing experience while maintaining markdown compatibility
- Offer a clean, distraction-free writing environment
- Support modern web technologies and best practices
- Be extensible and customizable for different use cases

ClearMark is particularly useful for developers, writers, and content creators who want a modern markdown editor that combines the power of rich text editing with the simplicity of markdown.

## Architecture

### System Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/    # Reusable React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/      # React context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/        # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/       # Global styles and Tailwind configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/        # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/        # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx     # Application entry point
```

The modular design ensures separation of concerns, with components, hooks, and context providers working together to create a cohesive editing experience.

### Core Technologies

- **React 18**: Modern UI framework with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

### üé® Modern UI

- Responsive design
- Dark/Light mode support
- Customizable themes
- Clean, distraction-free interface

### üíß Fluid Design Methodology

ClearMark's interface is inspired by the natural flow of water, creating a seamless, intuitive experience:

- **Flow-Based Aesthetics**: Interface elements mimic the natural movement of rainwater flowing down a stream
- **Asymmetric Border Radius**: Custom border-radius-fluid with varying corner values creates a subtle flow direction
- **Gradient Transitions**: Smooth color gradients transition from sky to cyan tones, evoking the feel of moving water
- **Depth & Transparency**: Strategic use of opacity and backdrop blur creates a sense of depth like looking through water
- **Fluid Animations**: Transitions use custom cubic-bezier curves that follow the physics of fluid movement
- **Cohesive Color Palette**: A carefully crafted "flow" palette with blues and teals connects all UI elements

#### Design Implementation

- **Light Mode**: Soft sky blues with subtle cyan accents mimicking daylight reflecting off water
- **Dark Mode**: Deep slate and blue-black backgrounds that evoke flowing water at night
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and controls feature directional styling that suggests downstream movement
- **Dividers**: Gradient dividers that transition from light to dark, creating a sense of water flowing
- **Shadows & Highlights**: Custom shadow effects give the impression of light passing through water

This water-inspired design philosophy creates a more organic, natural interface that feels less rigid and mechanical than traditional UI designs, helping users feel more connected to the creative flow of writing.
